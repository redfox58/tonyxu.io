      <description>This Is Silicon Valley (onezero.medium.com)
 Everyone wears Patagonia and North Face, everyone has AirPods hanging from their ears, and everyone goes to Lake Tahoe on weekends. And everyone talks about the same things: startups, blockchain, machine learning, and startups with blockchain and machine learning.

      <description>UTC is Enough for Everyone, Right? (zachholman.com)
 It turns out humans have had a long, long history of poorly dealing with time, so when you hammer your head against the wall trying to deal with a timezone bug, well, you’re just the last in a long, long line of human beings that are terrible at all this! Congrats. You’re pretty unremarkable.
 The author talks about long history of time and how horrible we have been dealing with time.</description>
