      <description>The Java language assumes that you want to do only object-oriented programming, so (almost) everything in Java is an object.
You manipulate objects with references You treat everything as an object, using a single consistent syntax. Although you treat everything as an object, the identifier you manipulate is actually a &amp;ldquo;reference&amp;rdquo; to an object.
For example:
String s; You must create all the objects When you create a reference, you want to connect it with a new object.</description>

      <description>The progress of abstraction Five basic characteristics of object-oriented programming:
 Everything is an object.
 A program is a bunch of objects telling each other what to do by sending messages.
 Each object has its own memory made up of other objects.
 Every object has a type
 All objects of a particular type can receive the same messages.
  An object has an interface The interface determines what request you can make for a particular object.</description>
