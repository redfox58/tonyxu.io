I live in the San Francisco bay area with my fiancée Helen.\nI started this blog in 2018.","tags":null,"title":"About","type":"page","url":"https://tonyxu-io.pages.dev/about/","weight":0,"wordcount":108},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"Google Analytics Dashboard","dir":"analytics/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"577338049f2197f1dac4d500e2ebcd34","permalink":"https://tonyxu-io.pages.dev/analytics/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/analytics/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Analytics","type":"analytics","url":"https://tonyxu-io.pages.dev/analytics/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"keywords":null,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"zh","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"","permalink":"https://tonyxu-io.pages.dev/zh/categories/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/zh/categories/","section":"categories","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Categories","type":"categories","url":"https://tonyxu-io.pages.dev/zh/categories/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"keywords":null,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"","permalink":"https://tonyxu-io.pages.dev/categories/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/categories/","section":"categories","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Categories","type":"categories","url":"https://tonyxu-io.pages.dev/categories/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design","dir":"books/clean-architecture/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"keywords":null,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"1ab41fa19d3f28d9bb9e9d1f501cfd18","permalink":"https://tonyxu-io.pages.dev/books/clean-architecture/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/books/clean-architecture/","section":"books","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Clean Architecture","type":"book-chapters","url":"https://tonyxu-io.pages.dev/books/clean-architecture/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"friends/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f3d39588ab872b35e524442cc784c609","permalink":"https://tonyxu-io.pages.dev/friends/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/friends/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Friends","type":"friends","url":"https://tonyxu-io.pages.dev/friends/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"In this lectures, Liu Qing introduces 19 thinkers in modern field of vision, which tells the pros and cons of instrumental reason, how to face nihilism, the alienation of consumerism to human beings and the fairness and justice of wealth distribution.","dir":"books/lectures-on-modern-western-thought/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"keywords":null,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"814ed3242f70f014d230fa3ae7bb964c","permalink":"https://tonyxu-io.pages.dev/books/lectures-on-modern-western-thought/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/books/lectures-on-modern-western-thought/","section":"books","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Lectures on modern western thought","type":"book-chapters","url":"https://tonyxu-io.pages.dev/books/lectures-on-modern-western-thought/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"refer/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7e32b8785376ff2d353f6869905747da","permalink":"https://tonyxu-io.pages.dev/refer/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/refer/","section":"","summary":"  #referral-iframe { height: 2300px;
