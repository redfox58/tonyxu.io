      <description>GitHub has become the one and only platform for developers. We collaborate on the platform for anything about code. Can GitHub help you anything else besides code? I have recently been frustrated choosing a tool to manage my personal knowledge base, although there are lots of choices such as note apps (Bear, Evernote), project management app (Trello), or knowledge management app (Notion.so), eventually GitHub turned out to my choice which has below pros:</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are using Google Analytics to analyze site traffic, you might want to embed those amazing dashboards to your website publicly. While Google doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide iframe solution, it does offer a &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/embed/v1/&#34;&gt;Google Analytics Embed API&lt;/a&gt; which requires a bit more technical knowledge. I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through each and every step and make sure you don&amp;rsquo;t have to read all developer documentation and can easily build dashboard&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://tonyxu.io/posts/2018/http-deprecate-x-prefix/</guid>
      <description>In June, 2012, Internet Engineering Task Force released a new RFC(RFC-6648), recommending deprecation of X- prefix. As LinkedIn also use this type of prefix, I was interested to read this RFC, and explain to you why we need to deprecate it.
X- prefix background HTTP header is used to transmit additional information between client and server.
Some standard HTTP header:

      <guid>https://tonyxu.io/posts/2018/oauth2-pkce-flow/</guid>
      <description>If you are building a native application, and you need OAuth 2.0, PKCE OAuth is your best choice. Here I will explain why.
Native application is often used to refer to native application that has no back-end, and running totally in user&amp;rsquo;s devices such as Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android, where securely storing secrets is impossible.
What are the OAuth 2 options for those native applications and what are the pros and cons for them?</description>

      <guid>https://tonyxu.io/posts/2018/use-gitlab-ci-to-run-free-scheduled-jobs/</guid>
      <description>In this topic, I&amp;rsquo;ll introduce how to run scheduled job with GitLab-CI, without the need to have a server running cron job or other application.
GitLab-CI is a continuous integration/deployment tool, it will trigger some scripts (such as build, test, deployment) when there is new deployment or defined interval. GitLab-CI has a free quota of 2,000 minutes running time, which is 1 hour everyday.
If you prefer GitHub than GitLab, Travis CI also offers similar tool for free.</description>

      <description>FontAwesome is an awesome font library. With fontawesome, it will be super easy to inject icon into your html page. Although the default method is very simple, it has the drawback of taking too much load by loading full set of icons.
In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll share how I reduce the fontawesome library size by using IcoMoon to generate icon library that only has what I need.

      <description>Talking about my experience with cloud computing, the first experience is when I&amp;rsquo;m in 11th grade, deploying a proxy application in Google App Engine to get over the Great Fire Wall in China. Later when I&amp;rsquo;m a freshman in college, I built a website for fun and subscribed shared hosting online. However, I found out that shared hosting has too many restrictions such as you have no control over softwares, so I switched to VPS.</description>

 Write to a image file in /tmp folder
 Use boto3 to upload image file to AWS S3
  Implementation Now we have the idea to achieve the goal, let&amp;rsquo;s do it in Alfred workflow and python script.</description>

The main thing on my list this month is to get familiar with the technology, tool, process, and products in LinkedIn. Although there is not a lot of happening, I should still look back and think about what can be improved.</description>
