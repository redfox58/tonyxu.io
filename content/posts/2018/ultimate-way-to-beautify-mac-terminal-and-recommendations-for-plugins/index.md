If you are using Mac as development machine, `Terminal.app` must be one of the most used apps. Terminal might be not fancy to begin with, but you can totally make it more elegant and fancy if you follow with me.

## We will be doing these for our Terminal

1. Install Terminal Profile: Customize Terminal Color
2. Install `oh-my-zsh`: Use powerful `zsh` for Terminal, instead of `shell`
3. Install `oh-my-zsh` themes: Beautify `oh-my-zsh`
4. Instal `oh-my-zsh` must-have plugins: Get more advanced and convenient features for Terminal

## Preparation

Recommend to install `homebrew` first:

```sh
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Install zsh if you are on macOS version prior to Catalina:

```sh
# Install zsh
brew install zsh
# Set zsh as your default shell
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh
```

## Install Terminal Profile

1. Go to [osx-terminal-theme](https://github.com/lysyi3m/osx-terminal-themes) and download your favorite theme in `scheme` folder
2. Double click the theme file to install and set as default
